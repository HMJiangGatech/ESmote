# ESmote
An R package including fast SMOTE algorithm

This is part of my undergraduate final year project. Which provide a really fast implementation of SMOTE algorithms.

If you have any concerns please contact me: jianghm.ustc@gmail.com

Some functions are still underconstruction. 
Ex. I developed a semi-supervised autoencoder to deal with high-dimensional data. However I did not provide a well documented R warpper. You may refer to the source code.
